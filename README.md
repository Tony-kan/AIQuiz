## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) account (you can use a free Atlas cluster)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tony-kan/AIQuiz.git
cd aiquiz-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables.

```env
# .env.local

# Get this from your MongoDB Atlas cluster connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# A strong, secret key for signing JWTs. You can generate one here: https://generate-secret.now.sh/32
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
